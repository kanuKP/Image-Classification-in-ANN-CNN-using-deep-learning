# Image-Classification-in-ANN-CNN-using-deep-learning
# Image classification was done on the given BIL-image dataset “apex12bands” of 8 bands, 12 bands and 17 bands using the concepts of ANN/CNN and deep learning. The implementation was done using the editor Anaconda.
# The image was classified into 7 clusters namely grasslands, building1, building2, bright forest, dull forest, river and road. 
# Encouraging results of 94.21% accuracy were achieved as a result of fuzzy classification.
